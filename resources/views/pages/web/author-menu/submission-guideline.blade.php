        Multidisciplinary Research Journal. Plagiarism is strictly

      <p>
        Plagiarism refers to the practice of using someone else's work,
        ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or
        permission. This includes, but is not limited to, copying text,
        ideas, or data without citation, paraphrasing others’ work
        without appropriate attribution, and submitting someone else’s
        work as one’s own.

          that are borrowed from other sources should be clearly
          referenced according to the publication's citation
